Python • RabbitMQ • Flask • Scalable Worker Architecture Final Project – Parallel & Distributed Systems The Distributed Text Processing System (DTPS) is a scalable, fault-tolerant distributed application designed to demonstrate The system accepts text-processing tasks (uppercase, reverse string, word count) from users and distributes them across multiple worker machines. Each worker processes tasks independently and returns a result, including the worker's hostname and IP, proving real distributed execution.
System architecture design finalized​
 Broker setup (RabbitMQ) and initial
connection tests successful​
Implemented multiprocessing-based chat
server​
 Multithreaded client capable of
sending/receiving messages concurrently​
