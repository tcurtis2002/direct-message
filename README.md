Python • RabbitMQ • Flask • Scalable Worker Architecture Final Project – Parallel & Distributed Systems The Distributed Text Processing System (DTPS) is a scalable, fault-tolerant distributed application designed to demonstrate:
	•	Distributed task execution
	•	RabbitMQ-based message brokering
	•	Dynamic worker node scaling
	•	Controller/worker architecture
	•	Real-time distributed logging
	•	Client-facing HTTP interface

The system accepts text-processing tasks (uppercase, reverse string, word count) from users and distributes them across multiple worker machines. Each worker processes tasks independently and returns a result, including the worker's hostname and IP, proving real distributed execution.
